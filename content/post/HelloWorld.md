This blog is about software development.

Aim of this blog is to structurize my own knowledge in software development and software architecture and to present this to the ones who will be interested.

This will start as a series of posts with the summary of different architecture-related posts and books. The materials will be kept is the corresponding SWA (software architecture) reading list.

This will continue with posts on different topics related to software architecture, first of these posts will be devoted to different architecture development processes. Of course, some of the posts will be devoted to particular technologies.
